Here's a collection of some of my favorite projects:

## Cat Name Genius
**Description:** Cat Name Genius is a web application that allows users to upload a picture of their cat and select a gender. The site uses a convolutional neural network (CNN), trained on a dataset of around 50,000 cat images, to analyze the photo and recommend a fitting name for the cat. The model leverages image recognition to produce creative and fun name suggestions based on the cat's appearance and gender.
