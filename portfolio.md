# Portfolio
Here's a collection of some of my favorite projects:

## Cat Name Genius
**Description:** Cat Name Genius is a web application that allows users to upload a picture of their cat and select a gender. The site uses a convolutional neural network (CNN), trained on a dataset of around 50,000 cat images, to analyze the photo and recommend a fitting name for the cat. The model leverages image recognition to produce creative and fun name suggestions based on the cat's appearance and gender.

## Intelligence Report Generator
**Description:** This project automates the daily generation of intelligence reports by scraping and summarizing news articles from sources like Yahoo News. Using Python, machine learning models, and scheduling tools, it generates concise summaries of relevant news articles, making it easier to stay informed.
